# Early Explorations

This directory contains the initial, exploratory programs developed before we focused on the final `DipoleToolKit`. These early attempts, while not directly part of the current toolkit, provide valuable insight into the project's evolution and the problem-solving process.

## Program Descriptions:

### `Quiz_v0.py`
This was our very first attempt at the core functionality that would eventually become the `DipoleToolKit`. Initially, there was a misunderstanding, and the idea was to create a quiz-like application. While this direction was not pursued, it represents the starting point of the project.

### `CountryNames_v0.py`
This program represents our first effort to obtain a list of countries. Although this specific functionality wasn't ultimately used in the `DipoleToolKit`, it led to the discovery that the `pycountry` library (`pip install pycountry`) would be necessary for potential future features involving country-specific data.

### `CanadianBands_v0-Failed.py`
This script was our initial, unsuccessful attempt to define Canadian amateur radio bands for "Option A" of what would become the `DipoleToolKit`. This attempt highlighted the need for a structured table of band information. The subsequent approach involved utilizing the Radio Amateurs of Canada (RAC) online band plan to create a more accurate and comprehensive solution.

### `AntennaOffsetCorrector_v0.py`
This program represents our first attempt to implement the antenna offset correction feature, which eventually became "Option B" in the final `DipoleToolKit`. This early version laid the groundwork for the more refined implementation in the toolkit.

These early programs illustrate the iterative nature of software development, showcasing both the initial ideas and the learning process that led to the final `DipoleToolKit`.
