# Ham Radio Antenna Tool Kit

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts designed to assist Ham Radio operators with antenna calculations and related tasks.
It was created for practical use with my Multi-Band Inverted V Antenna and as a collaborative exploration of software development with Google's AI Assistant Gemini. 

## Included Tools:

* **Two-Option_ToolKit_v1.py:** Provides a basic calculation for antenna length based on frequency.
* **Two-Option_ToolKit_v2.py:** Adds functionality to calculate the necessary length correction for a dipole antenna based on measured frequency offset.
* **Two-Option_ToolKit_v3.py:** Introduces a "Clear Screen" option to improve the user interface within the terminal.
* **Two-Option_ToolKit_v4.py:** Organizes the RAC band list into a more screen-friendly three-row layout.
* **Two-Option_ToolKit_v5.py:** Fixes a bug encountered when working with centimeter-wave bands.
* **Two-Option_ToolKit_v6.py:** Enhances the user experience with a welcome screen and improved indentation for better readability.
* **DipoleToolKit_v7.py:** The final version of the tool, featuring improved error handling and a renaming in preparation for potential Dockerization.

## Usage:

Each script is designed to be run from the command line using Python. Simply navigate to the directory containing the scripts and execute them using `python <script_name>.py`. Follow the on-screen prompts to use the tools.
