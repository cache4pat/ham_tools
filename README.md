# Ham Radio Antenna Tool Kit

This repository contains a Python script designed to assist Ham Radio operators with antenna calculations and related tasks.
It was created to practice Python Tool making for my Inverted-V Antenna, in a learning collabortion with Google's AI Assistant Gemini. 
The first six versions represent steps in my journey towards the FINAL full featured version: DipoleToolKit_v7.py

## Included Tools:

* **Two-Option_ToolKit_v1.py:** Explores a basic calculation for antenna length based on frequency.
* **Two-Option_ToolKit_v2.py:** Adds functionality to calculate the necessary length correction for a dipole antenna based on measured frequency offset.
* **Two-Option_ToolKit_v3.py:** Introduces a "Clear Screen" option to improve the user interface within the terminal.
* **Two-Option_ToolKit_v4.py:** Organizes the RAC band list into a more screen-friendly three-row layout.
* **Two-Option_ToolKit_v5.py:** Fixes a bug encountered when working with centimeter-wave bands.
* **Two-Option_ToolKit_v6.py:** Enhances the user experience with a welcome screen and improved indentation for better readability.
* **DipoleToolKit_v7.py:** This is the final tool version, featuring improved error handling.

## Usage:

Each script is designed to be run from the command line using Python. Simply navigate to the directory containing the scripts and execute them using `python <script_name>.py`. Follow the on-screen prompts to use the tools.
